            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹. I'm Sunny, a developer based outside of Chicago, that
            loves to code and build innovative software solutions. I studied
            Computer Science at the Univeristy of Iowa. From my sophmore year, I
            led the development of the high voltage drivetrain and vehicle
            control systems for the Iowa Formula Racing team where I truly fell
            in love with the engineering and development process. Automation,
            improving efficency, and building meaningful user-centric products
            are a passion of mine. Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar,
            cooking, longboarding, and working on the perpetual project that is
            owning a 90's JDM convertible.
